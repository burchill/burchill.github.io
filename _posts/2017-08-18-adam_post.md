When a keyboard enthusiast pictures a keyboard case in their mind, it's often one of two things: a standard minimalistic covering or a sleek industrial design.  RAMA's M65-a, /u/evangs' MiniVan, the FJELL keyboard case---the gorgeous curves and edges of these keyboard revel in simplicity and modern machining.  

I love the look, but I sometimes feel that this aesthetic has a somewhat limited imagination. Just because the *technology* is modern doesn't mean the *form* has to look modern. In fact, I think technology has progressed to the point where we can start looking *back* for artistic inspiration.

## Introducing _ADAM_

**ADAM** is a Neoclassical split ortholinear porcelain keyboard. Those words have probably never been arranged next to each other in the history of the universe, but here we are. As mechanical keyboards become luxury goods, **ADAM** harkens back to a time when "fancy" didn't mean "minimalist," and ornamentation reigned supreme.

<p class = "figcaption">Another view from the side. From here on out, I'll stop the hokey photoshops and keep the stand-in keys and the keyboard body the same color. </p>

### The Inspiration

The name **ADAM** is doubly fitting: it is a reference to both the Biblical Adam, as it's the first of its kind, and the Adam brothers who created the style of architecture that inspired it ([known as "Adam style" or "Adamesque"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_style)).

![Gloss white with stand-in caps, viewed from the front.]({{ site.url }}/_posts/figures/static_files/adam_ic/white_keys_front.png)

<p class = "figcaption">I'm currently working on two colors of glazes: Celadon green and gloss white. Early prototypes will be in Celadon green, as it highlights the features better than gloss white, and is easier to work with in terms of consistency/pooling.  Ignore the cutoff text in the bottom left corner--these were rendered online, so all I have are screenshots.</p>

The fact that Adam style incorporates simplified Rococo and Baroque elements works perfectly with the natural constraints of the manufacturing process.  Not only would the intricate detail and complex geometries of *true* Rococo/Baroque be lost in the glazing process, but they could have easily pushed the keyboard over the edge from "ornate" to "really, _really_ gaudy."

The front of the keyboard features a cartouche surrounded by paneling. I actually drew the bolection profile for the paneling to imitate one actually used at the Palace of Versailles, but sadly the detail is too fine to make out in the finished product.

<p class = "figcaption">This is what will actually be printed for the Let's Split PCB version. (The hand-wired version will probably have a further ledge below for mounting the chip/batteries/etc.) The plate will be mounted on the ledges (one of which you can see from this angle), leaving the underside open for access and LEDs.</p>

The sides of the keyboard are decorated with simplified [festoons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festoon). Festoons are characteristic of the Adam style, and keep the sides interesting while not distracting (also, festoons are sometimes called *swag*, which is pretty funny). I might test how adding more detail to festoons looks, but the smoothness is growing on me.

<p class = "figcaption">A side view of what will actually be printed for the PCB version, demonstrating the festoons.</p>

The rear has two holes for the MicroUSB cable and TRRS jack, and sports the classic Greek urn---an object prevalent in the Adam brothers' work. The renders on this page are from a version designed to accommodate /u/wootpatoot's [Let's Split v2 PCB](https://github.com/climbalima/let-s-Split-v2). 

![Celadon green with stand-in caps, viewed from the back.]({{ site.url }}/_posts/figures/static_files/adam_ic/green_keys_back_close.png)

<p class = "figcaption">A view of the back design for the PCB version, with the festoons that I'm considering removing. Again, the keycaps are not going to be printed. Notice the slight asymmetry.</p>

Somewhat frustratingly, the USB and TRRS connections are not symmetrically aligned on the PCB, meaning that the holes in the back cannot be equally spaced. Hand-wired versions of this case will feature nicely symmetric holes for those interested in wiring it themselves.  I'm currently debating whether the festoons on the back are too distracting---feedback would be appreciated.

## Why Porcelain? 

To me, it doesn't make sense to make **ADAM** in anything *other* than porcelain. Other than architecture, pottery has always been my favorite form of art.  Most hobbyist plastic keyboard prints I've seen turn out looking relatively ugly to me (loads of layer lines), requiring lots of sanding and painting to make them look professional. The 3D printing process for porcelain makes everything smooth and even, gives it a nice heft and feel, and the way some of the glaze pools and highlights the features of the keyboard looks stunning.[^1]

The obvious "drawback" of using ceramic is that if you drop it, it might crack. But I don't really consider this a drawback so much as something inherent to the sort of product I'm trying to make. 

### **ADAM** is *not* designed to be a travel keyboard. 

It is meant to sit on your desk, similar to a piece of furniture.  Although it is relatively durable, if it breaks, you can do what people have been doing with broken pottery for thousands of years: you can **_repair it_**.

To me, cracks in a piece of pottery make it look more interesting---give it more *history*---which is what I had in mind when designing **ADAM**. I love the idea of embracing this aesthetic, maybe even drawing *attention* to the history of the object, such as using [kintsugi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi) to highlight the cracks.  I'm honestly debating whether I want to *intentionally* shatter my first production and glue it back together with kintsugi[^2]---a porcelain keyboard with golden spiderweb cracks would look *amazing*.

## Customization / alternative versions

The 3D printing process for porcelain (at least for the time being) means that each piece is produced individually.  While this limits cost reduction, it also means that I have less pressure to commit to a singular design.  For example, I could include initials in the cartouche on request.  I've also been testing out bas-reliefs on the keyboard case.  The resolution and glazing limits the detail to almost silhouette quality, however.

### Profiles in _bas-relief_

I currently have a (somewhat coarse) relief of [Robert Adam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Adam) as a profile to commemorate his contribution. I _wanted_ to pair that with this relief of [Christopher Latham Sholes](http://www.wisconsinhistoricalmarkers.com/2015/07/christopher-latham-sholes-1819-1890.html), the inventor of the typewriter (and QWERTY), but I haven't found anybody near Milwaukee willing to go out there and take pictures for me.

### Designs that didn't make the cut

Another characteristic of Adam style is the use of Roman/Greek statues. I toyed with the idea of including deep-relief statues, but ultimately abandoned it when I was soliciting early feedback.  People thought they were too gaudy/too hard to make out.  They still have a soft spot in my heart, so I thought I would show them off anyway.

<p class = "figcaption">Testing out a bust of Joan of Arc.  People complained about the blobbiness and the awkwardly glazed boobies.</p>

I personally agree that these are too _representational_ compared to the rest of the design of the keyboard, but I'm interested to know if people think otherwise.

## Next steps

At this point, I'm just testing the waters and looking for feedback.  I'll be making some early personal prototypes next, and finishing the design for the plate and the mounting system.  Because working with porcelain is literally working with fire, I'd probably offer reduced prices for early adopters so I can get feedback and work out any kinks. After that, I might run a group buy, or just sell them online.

If you're not a fan of Neoclassical design, I have a few other designs I'll be working on in the future.  Right now, I'm considering a Chinese-inspired design and a tilted, low-profile, Art Deco design. But those will definitely not be ready this year.

## Preliminary details

**ADAM** is a split ortholinear porcelain keyboard case---it's high profile and designed with the SA profile in mind (in particular, Signature Plastic's ["Ice Cap" keyset](https://pimpmykeyboard.com/sa-ice-cap-keyset/)). It will be compatible with the Let's Split v2 PCB, but will have handwired versions available as well. The constraints of working with porcelain necessitate designing a special plate, so **ADAM** will not be compatible with previous Let's Split plates.  

Unlike [Adrien Friggeri's new 'Blanck' keyboard](http://medium.com/@friggeri/the-new-blanck-keyboard-c7563c4f9fa) (which admittedly inspired this whole endeavor), **ADAM** will be designed so that the only personal assembly one will need to do is to glue in M3 standoffs and screw in the top plate. The renders do not yet include the mounting slots for the standoffs---I'm still finalizing the exact specifications for these.

I haven't set prices yet, but each half will be *at least* \$100. If there is a lot of interest, I might be able to work out a deal with the manufacturers, although that's *highly* doubtful. I'm guessing a full keyboard set (plates included) is likely to run for about \$275-\$300.  

Feedback is much appreciated![^3]

### Footnotes

[^1]: Another benefit is that every order can be printed and shipped individually, without any extra expense, and will only take approximately 15 days from ordering to shipping! Meaning you won't have to deal with the tedium and frustration of Massdrop or bungled group buys!

[^2]: "Actual" kintsugi uses lacquer as a joiner, but there are loads of videos online on how to achieve similar effects by yourself with tools like super-glue.
