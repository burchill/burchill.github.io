# My (Zach Burchill's) website!

This here's my academic/professional website, see? 

Most of the "theme" is based off a [pretty Github landing page](https://github.com/excentris/compass), and it uses [knitr-Hyde](https://github.com/homerhanumat/knitr-hyde) to convert .Rmd files into HTML, but everything else is me and I'm actually relatively proud of it!
