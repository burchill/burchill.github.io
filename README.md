# Zach Burchill's website

This here's my academic/professional website, see? 

Most of the "theme" is based off a [pretty Github landing page](https://github.com/excentris/compass) I found, and it uses [knitr-Hyde](https://github.com/homerhanumat/knitr-hyde) to convert .Rmd files into Jekyll blog posts, but pretty much literally everything else is me and I'm actually very proud of it!

I also made it so that my twin brother and I can share blog posts automatically across our sites (he forked mine) with a git sub-module, which is pretty neato, but it seems I've been responsible for ~95% of the posts!  It also has a cool feature where it will switch color schemes depending on the author of the post. 

Also, I should add that I'm not responsible for anything he posts, so if he writes some weird stuff, take it up with him!
